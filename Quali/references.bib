	abstract = "Producing high-quality software has been one of the greatest challenges of the development market in the last few years. The software testing is the essence of the quality assurance, but the implementation of this activity is still difficult due to many factors. This paper presents some factors that influence on the adoption of a testing process. Some of these factors were outlined in the literature, and others were selected empirically based on the work experience obtained in a large company. Besides, this paper presents the results of a survey carried out to identify factors that make difficult the implementation of software testing process in small-sized software organizations and a proposed approach of a testing process to them.",
